"""
We provide this file as an example of how to use the LogisticRegressor class
with the NSCLC dataset. You can use this both to test your implementation
and as a guide for how to use the NSCLC dataset in your unit test(s). You
don't necessarily need to change anything in here (aside from uncommenting)
unless you want to.
